# About

We <3 open source, but being open isn't just about source code; its about ideas. To that end we want this project to be open from start to finish. 

The 'discussion' repo is a catch-all for discussions that aren't project-specific. If you have something you'd like to share with us, ideas on how we can make FET better, or want to contribute to an ongoing discussion just open an issue or make a comment.
